Read in pcap files from a directory and replay them using tshark to a nic


---
Current Error:
./readpcap: line 17: [: 1696617359.850256000: integer expression expected

also getting a message like tshark isnt being run correctly or something but it seams to process file or looks like it maybe not sure.
